# iToddy UI 

 This is a Design System made to make your devolopment time quicker, so you can focus only in the funcionalities of your application 
and let us handle components and tokens! 

 For instalations you can run the followin code on your terminal: 

<Box>
    <Text as='span'>Only Tokens: </Text><Text as='span'>npm intall @itoddy-ui/tokens</Text>
</Box>
<Box>
    <Text as='span'>Tokens + React Components: </Text><Text as='span'>npm install @itoddy-ui/react</Text>
</Box>

# Firs, let's talk about the tokens! 

    As you can see in the documentation, the tokens refers to all colors, font sizes, spacings, font weights, radios and etc that are used in the
components packages, but you can fell free to use on your own components of your application! All masures are on a flexible way so your responsive 
model don't be affected by the token you chosen. The tokens are also agnostic of language, that means that you can use it on any language you want
without having any trouble.

# Now, the components! 

    The components are all made with the tokens that we saw before, all the spancing and sizes in gerenal are setted on a flexible masure too so they
can adjust to your application in a responsive way too. There are react components, so not like the token only react application can use the compoments
package with no trouble. 


Hope you guys find what you need in this Design System to make you devolopment time quicker, see ya !
